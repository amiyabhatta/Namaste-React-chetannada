Why we use Usecontext - to avoid prop drilling and to avoid passing props to all the components

Usecontext,redux,mobx are used for state,data management

difference between redux and redux toolkit

each store has multiple slices
slices has small store inside store
our componenet can not directly access the store

when we click on the button we need to dispatch an action
action will call a function(reducer)  and function will modify our cart (slice of redux store)
we can not directly modify the cart
function is known as reducer 

if we click on the +button it dispatch an action which is called the reducer which will modify the Slice of the store
(calling a function which will modify the slice of the store)
